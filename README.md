# Webpack Templates 

A sensible template for new JavaScript projects. 


## Features

  + Babel for ES6 Transforms 
  + WebPack as a Task Runner / Build Tool 
  + Live Reloading - Maybe? I haven't done this before. 
  + Pre-configured npm scripts
  	- npm run setup - (creates a nice folder structure for us to use)
    - npm run build - (run the build step on everything, once)
    - npm run watch - (watch all our source files for changes and run the compile step every time)

  + Moment.js as a Date/Time lib - Questionable? 
  + DOES NOT include JQuery! Include it yourself, if you _really_ have to
