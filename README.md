# Webpack Templates

A sensible template for new JavaScript projects.


## Features

  + Webpack & Babel for JavaScript Transforms
  + Gulp for SASS Transforms
  + Live Reloading - Maybe? I haven't done this before.
  + Moment.js - Nice Date/Time handling
  + Pre-configured npm scripts
    - npm run setup - creates a nice folder structure for us to use
    - npm run build:js
    - npm run watch:js
    - npm run build:sass
    - npm run watch:sass


## Instructions

  + Clone the Repo to a directory somewhere
  + npm run setup
  + Edit the Package.json to suit the name, repo, etc of your own project
  + Edit the README.md to reflect the details of your own project
  + Delte the .git folder
  + git init and continue as normal


## Requirements

  + NodeJS & NPM


## Suggestions

Things that are not enforced, but are recommended to do on your projects.

  + Write tasks in whatever tool you want, but call the tasks as NPM scripts! This way we don't have to hunt through multiple files to find them, or remember which tool does what.
  + Write JavaScript using [JavaScript Standard Style](http://standardjs.com)
