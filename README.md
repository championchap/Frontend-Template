# Webpack Templates 

A sensible template for new JavaScript projects. 


## Features

  + Babel for ES6 Transforms 
  + WebPack as a Task Runner / Build Tool 
  + Live Reloading - Maybe? I haven't done this before. 
  + Pre-configured npm scripts
    - npm run build 
    - npm run watch 

  + Moment.js as a Date/Time lib - Questionable? 
  + DOES NOT include JQuery! Include it yourself, if you _really_ have to
