# Frontend Template

A sensible, basic template for new Frontend projects.


## Features

  + Webpack & Babel for JavaScript Transforms
  + Gulp for SASS Transforms
  + Live Reloading - Maybe? I haven't done this before.
  + Moment.js - Nice Date/Time handling
  + Pre-configured npm scripts. E.g. npm run watch:sass
    - setup
    - build
    - build:js
    - build:sass
    - watch
    - watch:js
    - watch:sass
    - clean


## Instructions

  + Clone the Repo to a directory somewhere
  + npm run setup
  + Edit the Package.json to suit the name, repo, etc of your own project
  + Edit the README.md to reflect the details of your own project
  + Delte the .git folder
  + git init and continue as normal


## Requirements

  + NodeJS & NPM


## Suggestions

  + Write tasks in whatever tool you want, but call the tasks as NPM scripts! This way we don't have to hunt through multiple files to find them, or remember which tool does what.
